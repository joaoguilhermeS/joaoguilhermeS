## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸŒ±I'm currently learning JavaScript;
- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the ODE project in Federal University of Paraiba(UFPB);
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on a webpage for recording of students with Django and SQL;
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a little ashamed but I like to talk a lot (I know it doesn't make sense). ğŸ˜„
