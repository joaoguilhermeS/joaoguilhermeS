## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ±I'm currently learning JavaScript;
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the ODE project in Federal University of Paraiba(UFPB);
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on a webpage for recording of students with Django and SQL;
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a little ashamed but I like to talk a lot (I know it doesn't make sense). ðŸ˜„
