## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ±I'm currently studying and developing my habilities in ML applied to Computational View alongside with some C and C++ to apply at RTC systems;
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at Panops collaborating in Images Analysis Classification;
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate in python projects related to computational vision and data science;
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a little shy but I like to talk a lot (I know it doesn't make sense). ðŸ˜„
