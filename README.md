## Hi there 👋

- 🌱 I'm currently enhancing my skills in ML applied to Computer Vision, focusing on Generative AI and Facial Recognition Networks.
- 🔭 I’m the CTO & Co-Founder of YAITEC Solutions, where we specialize in AI solutions for small and medium businesses, offering AI Chatbots, AI Automation, AI agents, and cutting-edge AI technologies to optimize operations.
- 💼 Main projects developed at YAITEC:
  - 🗣️ **AI Chatbots**: Talking to your data in any format using Langchain, vector store databases, and LLM tools. Because who doesn't want a chatbot that knows everything?
  - 📚 **Full Stack AI Apps**: Utilizing open-source models (Dolly 2 and Llama) for Q&A with large company documents while ensuring total data privacy. No secrets spilled here!
  - 📊 **Data Analysis Apps**: Performing Data Analysis in SQL databases, CSVs, and external tools (APIs). It's like having a data wizard at your fingertips.
  - 🤖 **Automatic Sales Agents**: Talking with your leads and selling your products automatically. Because who needs a sales team when you have AI?
  - 🤝 **Collaborative AI Agents Projects**: Teamwork makes the dream work, even for AI.
  - 🕵️‍♂️ **Computer Vision Projects**: Using Deep Learning for real-time analysis. It's like having a superpower for seeing everything!
  - 🎨 **Generative AI**: Creating visuals and more. Turning imagination into reality.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Python projects related to computational vision and data science. Let's code something amazing together!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a little shy but I like to talk a lot (I know it doesn't make sense). 😄 Also, I once trained an AI to tell jokes, and now it thinks it's a stand-up comedian!

Here's a joke from my AI:
> Why did the neural network go to school?
> To improve its "learning" curve! 🎓😂
